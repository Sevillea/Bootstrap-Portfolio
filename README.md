# Bootstrap-Portfolio
A portfolio created using Bootstrap components

This portfolio began with starter code provided as a template to build from courtesy of the Bootcamp. However, I chose to build my html and css from scratch and so I did away with the starter code, incorporated new Bootstrap elements from https://getbootstrap.com/ 

This portfolio showcases varying projects whether underway or upcoming as part of my learning as a web-developer. The focus of this portfolio are the boostrap componants which, if compared to my previous portfolio (without bootstrap), there is a marked difference is style and smoothness.
